This is a very poor first impression to make on potential business partners, you are aware of this?"

    "On the other hand, that is a very generous offer and if I agree to it, we’re all but guaranteed to land this client. That and I guess he’s not that bad of a guy? A bit immature, acts before thinking, and the kind of guy who just fills me with the strong desire to punch someone."

    p "So, people, sorry for the delay. Elevator’s broken, had to take a roundabout way back. But I’m here now, so I believe you had some forms for me to look over before signing?"
    c1 "Um, yes, but as to the matter of Ms Santiago taking on the roll of your producer."
    p "Oh, yeah. Sorry about that, I got a little caught up in the moment. We can just forget that. Anyways, without further delay, let’s get to work."

        # Placeholder for the Blake line here that should be placed in scene 05 during the big fix update.

    p "Okay, so, next order of business would be..."
    a "Hang on!"
    "I don’t look it, but I always hated being the center of attention. All those eyes, staring at me, expecting something from me. It’s unnerving. Take a breath girl. Take a breath."
    a "This offer of yours." # Show the slip of paper again from earlier
    a "It’s pretty generous, but you’re essentially asking me to take time off from the job I was hired here to do in order to follow you along."
    a "That’s a huge potential loss in earnings, and it depends entirely on how popular you are."
    p "..."

    # Show Pat smirk
    p "Fair enough, what would you propose?"
    a "Well for starters, how about a cut of your earnings. That’s pretty standard for this sort of arrangement, isn’t it?"
    p "Fair enough, you are taking a big risk so I won’t ask you to work for pennies."
    p "I’ll give you 5%, how’s that?"
    a "Do I look like I was born this morning?"
    a "15%"
    p "Well, why don’t you just ask for my blood while you’re at it!"
    p "7%."
    a "I can do 13%."
    p "9%, maybe."
    a "11%."
    p "10%."
    "..." # Make sure there’s no sound in this part
    "...crap, my facial muscles are twitching! This was such a textbook negotiation example, that I didn’t think he’d go for it."
    "Keep steady, Ashley, don’t let him know that the offer is more than enough."
    p "Eh? What’s that I see? Come onnnnn, your resistance is fading~"
    "I crossed my arms and looked away, Feigning a pouting expression to not show him that the offer was acceptable, trying to hold out to see if he’ll offer something more."
    "..."
    "........."
    "......................."
    a "Very well. 10% is fair."
    p "Awesome! I don’t know why but I’m pretty excited about this~"
    a "I’m an adult, I care more about profit than fun."
    p "We’ll make that too!"
    p "Ah! I see that smile on your face, what’re you thinking?"
    a "I’m thinking about whether I should throw you from the roof or see if I can fit you through that window."
    p "That’s cold, bro."
    a "I’m not your bro, Pat."
    p "Ah! You said it, you called me, Pat! So you don’t totally hate my guts!"
    a "Like 90%."
    p "Good enough for me!"
    a "Okay, this comedy routine aside,"
    a "Before I shake your hand, I have one last thing to say."
    a "I don’t know anywhere near enough about you to say whether I want to be financially joined at the hip with you. I don’t have the time or patience to be chasing you around."
    a "However, I’m not totally opposed to it. So, how about a compromise. We’ll try this thing for about a month. If we’re not compatible work partners, then you’ll pick a new producer and I’ll go back to my normal desk job. Simple as that."
    p "That works for me!"
    a "Furthermore, I’m not your mom, your wife, or one of your fan girls."
    a "We’re business associates first and foremost. We will act like professionals and no more being late, agreed?"
    p "Agreed."
    a "And, I am aware that I can be a bit..."
    # These are also coworkers
    c2 "Overbearing?"
    c3 "Cold?"
    c4 "Tactless?"
    c1 "Scary beyond all reason?"
    a "...Marie, kindly remember the names of the people who just said something so I can get revenge later."
    a "But yes. You said that you have no patience for yes-men, well I would rather someone be open and upfront with me when I’m being unreasonable. So, part two of this deal, we communicate openly. Deal?"
    p "Deal."
    a "Good."
    "I look down at his outstretched hand, still hanging there like a limp branch. A part of me  wonders if I’m making the right decision."
    "But what did he say earlier? About trusting his instincts?"
    "I guess I could try it once."
    "I firmly grasp his hand, making a decision that I felt could impact the rest of my life."
    p "So, let’s start over fresh."
    # Hand-shaking CG would go here
    p "Hello, I’m Victor J Patrick, my friends call me Pat, and I look forward to working with you."
    a "Ashley Santiago, new hire, and I’ll be your producer for the time being. If we treat each other with professional courtesy, then we should have no problems."
    p "Agreed. Ya know, you have a really strong grip for someone so short- owowowowowowow!"
    c1 "Please don’t damage the talent, Ms Santiago! At least not until he’s signed the other forms!"
    p "It’s okay, I’m ambidextrous!"
    "I am instantly regretting this already."
    "..."
    "Well, only about 70% regret."
